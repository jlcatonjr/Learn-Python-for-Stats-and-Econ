    "# Incomplete Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating accurate predictions is one of the most valuable skills in the job market today. Statisticians, economists, and data scientists use data gathered from specific populations in order to make predictions about what behaviors are likely to occur in the future, or what the truth is about what has already occured. Through computational and statistical techniques, we can make _statistical inferences_ to draw conclusions from data that are often incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as estimations of parameters that already exist, having full population data would mean that our questions about that population are answered. But because the cost of gathering full population would, usually, outweigh the benefit of having perfectly accurate data, we are okay with using incomplete samples to make inferences. "

    "The term “index fund” refers to the investment approach of a fund. Specifically, it is a fund that that aims to match the performance of a particular market index, such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2,000. The index fund simply tries to match the market. This differs from a more actively managed fund, in which investments are picked by a fund manager in an attempt to beat the market. The age old question is: are the fees payed to an actively-managed mutual fund worth it? \n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply compare the mean return from a given date range for a mutual fund and compare it to the S&P500s mean return from the same time interval, and see which is higher. But the fact that mutual funds have a finite number of time intervals which we can sample means we cannnot rule out the possibility that higher or lower returns from the fund were a result of random variation, and not an indicator of the true quality of the fund. The S&P500 is , essentially, the market. We know all of the information we need about it, because it isnt a sample. The mutual fund data, on the other hand, is incomplete. So, we need to analyze the two funds using statistical techniques which account for random variation that is possible from incomplete data. \n",

    "We would like to ananlyze which(if any) mutual funds have out-performed the market, fees included. To start, we read the CSV downloaded from [Stock Market MBA](https://stockmarketmba.com/listoftop100activelymanagedusstockmutualfunds.php), which shows the 100 largest actively-managed mutual funds in the US.

    "Hypothesis testing can be done mentally. It would be burdensome to have to state your _null_ and _alternate_ hypotheses, and run through these four steps explicitly every time you made a predictive computer model. The point is that in means testing, there is a clear process and result that deliniates \"Yes, the true means of these samples are different\" and \"No, they're not significantly different\"\n",

    "While using T-tests and Z-tests to analyze means of groups, we were restricted to only being able to compare two groups at a time. What if we wanted to see of there was significant differences between more than two groups? The **ANOVA**, or **Analysis of Variance** techniques allow us to test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between $k$ (some integer larger than 2) groups. \n",

    "- $H_a$: At least two of the means are not equal. \n",

    "### Assumptions needed for ANOVA\n",
    "There are three assumptions that must be met in order to carry out an ANOVA test: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experimental errors of yoyr data are normally distributed\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity - the variances of your factors are all roughly the same (and at least follow the same distribution)\n",
    "3. Samples are independent - Selection of one sample had no effect on any other sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### F-Statistic\n",
    "The distribution used for the hypothesis test is a new one. It is called the F distribution, named after Sir Ronald Fisher, an English statistician. The F-statistic is a ratio. There are two sets of degrees of freedom; one for the numerator and one for the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The F distribution is derived from the t-distribution. The values of the F distribution are squares of the\n",
    "corresponding values of the t-distribution. One-Way ANOVA expands the t-test for comparing more than two groups.\n",
    "The scope of that derivation is beyond the level of this textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the F ratio, two estimates of the variance are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variance between samples**: An estimate of $\\sigma^2$ that is the variance of the sample means multiplied by n (when the sample sizes are the same.). If the samples are different sizes, the variance between samples is weighted to account for the different sample sizes. The variance is also called **variation due to treatment or explained variation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance within samples**: An estimate of $\\sigma^2$ that is the average of the sample variances (also known as a pooled variance). When the sample sizes are different, the variance within samples is weighted. The variance is also called **the variation due to error or unexplained variation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $SS_b$ = the sum of squares that represents the variation among the different samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- $SS_w$ = the sum of squares that represents the variation within samples that is due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a \"sum of squares\" means to add together squared quantities that, in some cases, may be weighted. We used sum of squares to calculate the sample variance and the sample standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "MS means \"mean square.\" $MS_b$ is the variance between groups, and $MS_w$ is the variance within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caluculating the F-Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k$ = the number of different groups\n",
    "- $n_j$ = the size of the $j^{th}$ group\n",
    "- $s_j$ = the sum of the values in the $j^{th}$ group\n",
    "- $n$ = total number of all the values combined (total sample size: $\\sum{n_j}$)\n",

    "- Explained variation: sum of squares representing variation among the different samples: $SS_{b} = \\sum{\\frac{(s_j)^2}{n_j}} - \\frac{(\\sum{(s_j)^2}}{n}$\n",
    "- Unexplained variation: sum of squares representing variation within samples due to chance:\n",
    "$SS_w = SS_{total} – SS_b$\n",
    "- $df$'s for the numerator(between samples): $df_b = k – 1$\n",
    "- $df$'s for the denominator($df$'s within samples): $df_w = k – 1$\n",
    "- Mean square (variance estimate) explained by the different groups:\n",
    "$MS_b = \\frac{SS_b}{df_b} = \\frac{SS_b}{k-1}$\n",
    "- Mean square (variance estimate) that is due to chance (unexplained): $MS_w = \\frac{SS_w}{df_w} = \\frac{SS_w}{n - k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-way ANOVA test depends on the fact that $MS_b$ can be influenced by population differences among means of the several groups. Since $MS_w$ compares values of each group to its own group mean, the fact that group means might\n",
    "be different does not affect $MS_w$. The null hypothesis says that all groups are samples from populations having the same normal distribution. The alternate\n",
    "hypothesis says that at least two of the sample groups come from populations with different normal distributions. If the null hypothesis is true, $MS_b$ and $MS_w$ should both estimate the same value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we arrive at the **F-Statistic**, which will function for us as the T-Statistic did earlier this chapter, as an input into its density function to recieve a p-value telling us the likelihood of its occurence if our null hypothesis was true. \n",
