    "# Central Banking\n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank is a fixture of the modern monetary environment. Central banks attempt to influence financial markets, often acting to target inflation, interest, and unemployment rates.  The theories so far presented are sufficient for interpreting the practice of central banking. Typically, the goal of the central bank is stated as promoting macroeconomic stability. In practice, that goal can be influenced by political context. Instability can result from policy decisions that are either insufficiently informed or beholden to political incentives. In this chapter we will consider the policy tools available to central banks and the dynamics that may arise in response to the policy of central banks. We begin by considering the precursor to central banking: the clearinghouse association. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Clearinghouse Associations\n",
    "\n",
    "Central banks were not without precedent. They evolved much as money evolved from barter and the banking system evolved as a means of lending money from savers to borrowers. Recall the evolution of economic development presented thus far. We begin with a world of scarcity where agents own property and take action according to their preferences. As agents interact, direct (barter) exchange arises. Each agent trades some good or goods that he owns for some other good or goods that he or she values more than the item or bundle given up. In each exchange, agents pays only as much for a good or goods as they are willing. Sometimes, a good desired by an agent can only be acquired by multiple exchanges. Imagine that agent A owns an apple, agent B owns an orange, and agent C owns an avocado. Agent A is willing to trade her apple for an avocado, but agent C will only trade her avocado for an orange. It just so happens that Agent B would like to trade his orange for an apple. Agent A, sensing an opportunity to attain her desired end, trades her apple for agent B’s orange. Then she trades the orange for an avocado. This is indirect exchange. Over time, some types of commodities, say oats, come into use for indirect exchange. The commodity used for indirect exchange comes to gain value for its use in indirect exchange. This value is its exchange value. Eventually, one or several of these moneys comes to dominate markets of indirect exchange. Money has developed whose price tends to reflect its supply and demand. One interesting feature of a commodity money is that its quantity is, in the long run, dependent on its supply and demand. If money becomes dearer due to an increase in demand for it, its price will rise and thereby increase the quantity of money supplied. A fall in demand will allow the quantity supplied in a given time period to fall. Thus, the quantity of money stock is self-regulated with respect to changes in demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commodity moneys are costly for agents carry. If the commodity money is not standardized, it may be difficult to measure. If it is heavy, like gold or silver, it may be costly, or even dangerous, to carry on one’s person. Owing, at least in part, to these reasons, agents find that they benefit from leaving their money entrusted to a third party at a secure location. The agent will likely receive a deposit slip in exchange which can be used as money. Thus we have the emergence of fiduciary currency. Eventually, the agent or firm entrusted with the gold realize that they might profit from lending out some portion of the existing deposits. This allows the latent media to earn a return. This return allows the agent or firm to pay interest on deposits. The cost of holding gold is no longer borne by the agent who owns the commodity. Fractional-reserve banking is born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks continually interact with one another. A account holder at one bank may wish to transfer part of his or her balance to an account holder at another bank. Every time this occurs, banks could transfer the full value of the transaction. A less costly option is to maintain an account of balances and to net out the difference between institutions at the end of each day. The clearinghouse was a banking nexus that allowed for members to perform this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "A clearinghouse is the location at which multiple banks may hold some of their reserves and keep their records. They have existed at different times in, for example, the United States, Canada, and England. By holding their reserves and records at a common location, banks can clear debits and credits between one another and use the reserves on hand to pay remaining debts between one another. In order to maintain their balances and ability to repay depositors, banks may sometimes borrow from one another. This need was efficiently served by other banks at the clearinghouse. This function was especially important in the case of an economic downturn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any bank in operation chooses to keep on hand some commodities whose value is equal to a portion of its reserves. This is needed in the case that some depositors want to immediately withdraw their currency from the bank. If too many depositors attempt to withdraw from the bank simultaneously, the bank may risk being unable to make a repayment. The bank could borrow from another bank in order to stave off hysteria, but what if many banks experience a banking panic simultaneously. If banks are unable or unwilling to lend to one another in this situation, they will have to close operations until they can acquire the funds necessary to repay depositors. This option is a last resort as it will certainly attract the attention of risk-averse depositors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Banks have incentive to minimize the occurrence of this scenario as a wave of collapses may have repercussions for the entire economy.  In addition to its more basic functions, a clearinghouse association helped promote stability the banking system, providing means of mitigating and even preventing an outright credit collapse.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The clearinghouse is itself a nexus of information concerning the creditworthiness of borrowers, thus serving a role in risk mitigation. The clearinghouse might also mitigate risk by producing temporary currency during a crisis. The clearinghouse had reserves on hand that could be used to support the creation of this currency. During a crisis the clearinghouse, ostensibly drawing from these reserves, lent out emergency currency. The clearinghouse would lend to banks that it deemed to be only illiquid. Those who borrowed could repay other members of the clearinghouse system with the emergency currency. The borrowing bank was expected to repay the loan with interest once the crisis was averted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since credit is employed predominantly for the sake of maintaining business operations, a net decrease in available credit typically diminishes the level of future production, and consequently, real income. Likewise, a collapse in the credit markets leads to a collapse in production until the collapse reverses (assuming it reverses). A wave of banking failures, like the one that occurred during the Great Depression, can turn an economic recession into a depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of self-preservation, the clearinghouse has incentive to prevent such an extreme crisis. Clearinghouses took an active role in regulating the positions of its member banks. If could, at random or on the suspicion of a poor banking practice, withdraw a large amount of funds from a member bank in order to test its capacity to handle adverse clearings. This served to discourage excessive risk taking by member banks and represented yet another means of promoting the stability within the system.  Having mechanisms that promote stability does not suggest that the system was itself perfect. Every system has bugs. There will always be some banks that take on excessive risk. There will always be failures. Irresponsible banks must fail or else they may corrupt the whole system as other banks begin to expect bailouts. The significance of the clearinghouse system is not that it prevented any instability, but that it placed bounds on that instability. Regulation and stability are themselves properties of the system as entrepreneurs earn profit by finding ways to mitigate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Central Bank as the Lender of Last Resort\n",
    "\n",
    "A central bank is  a financial institution either sponsored or given special privilege by the national government whose currency it regulates. The lender of last resort role is probably the strongest justification for central bank management of the money stock. During a crisis, banks need liquidity. Under some banking regimes, private banks collectively established institutions that stabilized the banking system during crises. Historically, central banks have been established because financiers and policymakers expected that the central bank could more efficiently serve this role .\n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank is responsible, not only for providing liquidity during a crisis, but also to manage the base money stock. This is of particular significance for the functioning of credit markets. If a bank or banks risk collapse, cannot acquire credit, and appears to be solvent, the central bank’s role is to provide temporary liquidity to the institution. This function provides stability to the system during periods of credit collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "When credit is expanded, this is typically indicative of an increase in the nominal value of production. This can occur either through an increase in production itself, an increase in prices, or an increase in demand for cash balances which may lead to an increase in demand for credit assuming that prices do not immediately adjust to accommodate the change in demand for money. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between credit and money implies a relationship between aggregate demand and credit. When the volume of credit extended increases on net, this is equivalent to an increase in the money stock, and therefore an increase in aggregate demand (MV). Changes in the credit stock, absent a change in demand for money, shifts the aggregate demand curve in the same direction. After a period where credit has been misallocated, something only discovered ex post, there must follow a contraction as the value of collateral adjusts to reflect underlying demands of the economy. While this process works to reallocated resources to their most highly value use, the fall in credit also precipitates a fall in income. Falling incomes encourages agents and firms to take a more conservative stance financially until they expect that the crisis is nearing an end. This tendency creates aggregate oscillations known as the business cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these oscillations in the volume of available money and credit grow extreme, banks that might otherwise be economically sustainable risk default. The same holds true for other businesses. In the worst case, these fluctuations may create a wave of insolvencies that turn a minor crisis into a financial pandemic. Nominal fluctuations begin to affect the structure of the real economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This occurred during the 2008-2009 crisis. Many large financial firms were holding bundles of AAA rated mortgage backed securities. The AAA rating hid from non-critical observers the risk contained in these securities. Before the crisis in 2007 and 2008, banks held these securities were able to acquire very high levels of leverage. The ratio of debt to cash on hand grew to dangerously high levels. When the value of these assets collapsed, leverage levels increased as many of these firms were on the brink of collapse. The bank's liabilities – mortgage backed securities – fell in price. This was equivalent to a drop in the broader money stock as it necessitated a contraction of credit in order for the system to stay solvent. In order to avoid collapse, the Federal Reserve provided the market with liquidity by buying up “toxic” assets, i.e., the overvalued mortgage backed securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Central Banking: The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Private systems of risk management represented by clearinghouse associations were largely displaced by central banks over the last one to two centuries. While the details of any particular central bank may vary,  a central bank is typically given the privilege of note issue. These notes circulate as legal tender and, as late as the first half of the 20th century, circulated alongside precious metals. Before the move to a fiat system, central bank notes were redeemable for precious metals that were supposed to back them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a fiat standard, the central bank controls the quantity of base money in circulation. It may choose this quantity either directly or indirectly. Traditionally, the tools by which the central bank has affected the quantity of money were limited to three types: the discount rate, setting of reserve requirements, and open market operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discount Rate \n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank lends money directly to other banks through the discount window. In the early days, this was the central bank’s primary means of intervention. It has come to play a smaller role in the modern environment. In the United States, The Federal Reserve only lends to member banks. These banks therefore play an intermediate role between the Federal Reserve and the rest of the banking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing loans to banks that might otherwise fail during a crisis, the central bank intends to stabilize financial markets. When conditions improve, the borrowing banks repay the debt incurred during crisis. While this may stabilize markets in the short-run, it may promote moral hazard, leading to increased risk-taking in the long-run. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Market Operations \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a favorite tool of policymakers at a central bank. Open market operations is the practice whereby central banks buy and sell debt on the open market. If the central bank purchases debt, it has increased the monetary base, usually with the expectation that this increase will promote credit creation. If the central bank sells, bonds, it diminishes the base money stock and, by so doing, discourages the creation of new credit. Most central bank policies imply an inflationary bias, so this latter case is less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the creation of new money is dependent upon the creation of debt, this means that the Federal Reserve must also offset repayment when it formulates monetary policy. If the central bank purchases a bond that matures in 5 years, this means that the money that was created to purchase the bond is returned to the Federal Reserve with interest by the end of the 5 year period. Thus, if the Federal Reserve ceased making new purchases on the open market, the quantity of money would actually shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of maturity can also play a role during a crisis. For example, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve for nearly two decades, often made large purchases of short-term bonds to provide temporary liquidity if there occurred or he expected a financial crisis. This was often referred to as the \"Greenspan put\". This is precisely what occurred in the lead up to the year 2000, when many were worried that the banking system may experience difficulty due to a glitch that might occur due to the switch from 1999 to 2000 in the software systems. Luckily this never became a problem. Still, Greenspan prepared the market by providing temporary liquidity that was quickly removed after the start of the new year (Figure X).\n",
    "\n",
    "When buying and selling bonds, the central bank must choose which kinds of bonds it will purchase. The central bank usually buys and sells government debt. In the U.S., this is divided into 3 categories: treasury bills, treasury notes, and treasury bonds. Treasury bills include U.S. Treasury debt that matures within one year. Treasury notes include include debt that matures in 1 to 10 years. Treasury bonds include any U.S. Treasury debt that matures over a period lasting more than 10 years. While purchases of securities by the central bank tend eventually to effect the entire financial market, the choice of maturity length will tend to move rates of the target maturity relative to other maturities. For example, if the Federal Reserve purchases securities that mature over a relatively short period, it may depress rates of that class of instruments relative to securities that mature over a longer period of time, say 30 years. \n",

    ">Figure 2 Federal Reserve Sells Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "Although central banks usually purchase and sell government debt, they can effectively  purchase any kind of debt or even assets. In its response to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve made large purchases of mortgage backed securities. At its height, these assets comprised nearly half of the value in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and continue to comprise a significant portion of that value.\n",

    ">Figure 3 Monetary Base (Billions of Dollars)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reserve Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank can influence the broader money stock by changing the proportion of commercial bank liabilities that are required to be held with the central bank. By increasing reserve requirements, the central bank contracts the total money stock. By decreasing reserve requirements, the central bank enables the expansion of the total money stock. Reserve requirements for large financial institutions in the U.S. currently stands at 10\\%. This means that the banking system, specifically deposit banking, can generate liabilities amounting to about 10 times the value of reserves in the system. \n",
    "The reserve ratio of the system of deposit banking subject to these reserve requirements is described:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$r = \\frac{R}{D}$\n",

    ">$Where:$\n",

    "\n",
    "The describes the reserve ratio that arises after money has been deposited at a bank. Then a fraction of the deposit, $(1 - r)$, is lent and deposited at another bank, and so forth. The money multiplier of the system can be described by the inverse of the reserve ratio, \\frac{1}{r}.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$M = \\frac{D}{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve exercised this policy tool to the detriment of productivity in the United States. It 1937, the Federal Reserve chose to increase the required reserve ratio from 20\\% to 35\\%. The result was that the quantity of money as measure by M2, which had been growing at a steady rate, actually began to shrink. The fall in lending led to a negative aggregate demand shock the significantly reduced productivity until the policy was reversed in 1938.\n",

    "# Post-2008 Monetary Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Monetary policy has taken a new form in the last decade. With this change, the Federal Reserve has begun to use a variety of new policy instruments that enable it to increase support for particular financial sectors without generating inflation. It accomplishes this primarily by payment of interest to banks who received the newly created money. This has led to rather complex outcomes that cannot be described by the tools mentioned above. Next, we will explain how this change the structure of monetary policy has created new opportunities for the Federal Reserve along with new dilemmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monetary Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "> Figure 5: Fed Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the 2008 crisis, monetary policy could largely be described in terms of the level of U.S. Treasuries (bonds) held by the Federal Reserve. Other assets such as gold and repurchase agreements (short term loans to the overnight lending market) were part of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, however these were especially minor parts. There was a tight correlation between the quantity of base money circulating in the financial system and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2008, this changed. When the crisis began, Chairman Ben Bernanke began to sell U.S. Treasuries and provide loans directly to businesses that he believed to be at risk of collapse. This was a stark change as U.S. monetary policy has typically operated by 1) using open-market operations to provide funds to financial markets generally without favoring particular firms and 2) lending through the discount window at a penalty relative to the market rate. For the most part, open-market operations have been the prominent tool of monetary policy since the Great Depression. The effect of monetary expansion via open-market operations tends to be inflationary. New money circulates in the economy, enabling an increase in total expenditures. Although in the short-run this may lead to a higher level of real income, in the long-run, an increase in the rate of money creation translates to an increase in the rate of inflation. At least, that used to be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after this change in policy at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve greatly increased its lending to foreign central banks and struggling domestic firms. Within a year or two, most of this expansion was transformed into substantial holdings of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. In implementing this transformation, the Federal Reserve greatly increased support for Federal borrowing and mortgage lending without increasing the rate of inflation. Next, we will explain how it accomplishes this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sterilizing the Effects of Monetary Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    ">Figure 6: Fed Liabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new monetary regime, the Federal Reserve not only increase the supply of of base money but also arbitrarily increases demand for base money. When the Federal increased its balance sheet in 2008 (Figure 5), it also simultaneously increased the total value of deposits that it pays banks to hold at the Federal Reserve. Banks holding excess reserves at the federal reserve receive interest on excess reserves (IOER). The Federal Reserve pays bank interest risk free if they hold their deposits at the Federal Reserve, thereby ensuring that the newly created money is not lent in the financial market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new policy instrument has, so far, operated in concert with the Federal Funds Rate. The Federal Funds Rate is the rate at which banks lend to one another, often overnight. The Federal Reserve targets this rate, which represents essentially the most secure kind of loan in the market. The Federal Reserve pays a risk free rate of return to members banks who hold reserves in excess of minimum requirements. Until summer 2018, the rate paid on excess reserves was equal to the upper federal funds target. This practically extinguished the overnight lending market as it is less risky to leave money on deposit at the Federal Reserve than to lend to other banks overnight. The current Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, lowered this rate relative to the upper target starting in summer 2018. The rate paid on excess reserves is currently 10 basis points (.1 percent) less than the Federal Reserve's upper target for the federal funds rate. \n",

    "\n",
    "> Figure 6: Federal Funds Market and Interest on Excess Reserves\n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank's role as lender of last resort creates a problem of second-order: moral hazard. In a system where stability is provided privately, provision of liquidity is constrained by expectation of repayment. This expectation is formed by the creditor’s local knowledge of the bank receiving emergency funds. In the private system, this role is decentralized as major players within different banking systems (networks) play the role of lender of last resort. The implementation of a central bank degrades this local knowledge and distorts incentives. Banks with relatively high levels of risky assets might not receive credit under the private system. They are more likely to receive credit under a system of central banking as 1) politics plays a greater role in allocating credit and 2) private bankers and investors may form the expectation that the central bank will always provide them liquidity. This encourages private banks to extend more credit than they would otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moral hazard has taken on a new form in the current regime. The ability of the central bank to guide resources in the economy without generating inflation has made federal borrowing and the mortgage sector increasingly dependent on support from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve holds well over 10% of debt owed by the federal government and provides a comparable level of support for the U.S. mortgage market. This support is only increasing with the recent intervention that occurred due to the COVID-19 shutdown of the economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the last crisis, the Federal Reserve will face resistance in unwinding its balance (i.e., selling its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and mortgages). For example, in September 2019, sales of debt from the federal government create a liquidity shortage in the overnight lending market. The Federal Reserve responded by increasing its holdings of U.S. Treasuries (Figure 5). This reversal of unwinding grew more extreme in response to the shutdown, elevating the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to well above $6 trillion from a recent low of $3.8 trillion. It's unclear if or when this new trend will reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "One little noticed effect of the payment of interest on reserves is that by paying interest on excess reserves, the Federal Reserve is growing the base money stock. This is due to the fact that more than half of all base money is not actually circulating in the economy. As the Federal Reserve allows interest rates to rise, the rate of money creation required to offset this tightening also increases. Thus, the rate paid on excess reserves is about equal to the rate of increase in the base money stock in circulation. It had seemed that this problem was stabilizing before the reversal of policy in September 2019. Figure 8 shows the interest rate paid on excess reserves along with the rates of growth of the total base money stock and the portion of the base money stock that is circulating (not collecting interest as excess reserves) until early 2019. With the reversal of policy, the Federal Reserve will once again have to manage allowing interest rates to rise while trying to limit interest payments on excess reserves.\n",
