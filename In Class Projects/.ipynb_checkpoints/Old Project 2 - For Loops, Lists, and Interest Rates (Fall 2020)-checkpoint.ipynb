    "# For Loops: Interest Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to solve problems: analytically and computationally. Most of us have been trained to solve problems analtyically. For example, when you solve a system of equations, you find the price point or points where the lines of interest intersect. Perhaps you are attepmting to solve for the quantity of production that will maximaize profits for a firm, so you set up a Lagangian. While analytic solutions are indispensable, it often makes sense to solve problems computationally. Sometimes, this means performing a series of operations that are prestated. For example, you can compound interest over $t$ periods instead of raising $(1+r)^t$. In essence, these result in the same thing, so this is the boring case. In the more interesting cases, computation allows us to *guess and check*. We could, for example, use computational methods to find which interest yields a particular future value by marginally increasing the interest rate when the future value is smaller than the target and decreasing the rate when it is larger than the target. Artificial intelligence uses this *guess and check* method (sometimes referred to as *brute force*). This method may be used in combination with the first method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will introduce for loops to understand their role in developing computational solutions to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must develop our understanding of for loops. We can think of for loops as a means of counting. The command *__for i in range(n)__* will count from i to n - 1. Let's get started by counting. "

It is a rather costly way to approximate solutions for math problems when computing is costly - say, when you have only paper and pencil at your disposal. However, when computational resources are especially cheap, as they are now, the \"guess and check\" method is often the best way to find a solution. Those of you who have taken courses in advanced mathematics might even be familiar with problems where there exist no analytical solution at all. In this case, the only suitable method for finding a solution is to *guess and check*. \n",
