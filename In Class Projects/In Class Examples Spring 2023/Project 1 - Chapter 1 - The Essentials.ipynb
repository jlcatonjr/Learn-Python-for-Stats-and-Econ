    "Learning to program is like learning to play a new instrument. While it is useful to spend some time reading about music, your instrument, music theory, and so forth, if one wants to learn to play they must practice reading and playing music. New musicians learn to play simple phrases and songs. Think of the exercises in this book as the equivalent for programming. To begin learning, simply copy the script and execute it. You might not understand what you are doing at first. That is okay. Just as musicians continue to play songs that they have already “learned”, you will benefit by reconstructing and further developing examples that you have already completed. Learn by doing.\n",

Likewise, integers by \"int\" and floats by \"float\". Particular formulations will vary, but the same pattern holds. You do not have to worry about this in Python.
