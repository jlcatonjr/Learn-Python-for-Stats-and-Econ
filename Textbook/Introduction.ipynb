    "## Introduction: Learn Python for Economic Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "More than ever, programming skills are essential for professional success. This is true whether your work is in business or in academia. Further, programming is often not enough. You must also be able to work with statistical software or libraries. While many books exist to teach you how to program, there are none that I know of that do a good job of providing training in statistic and econometrics while also providing good programming habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "In learning to program, it is good to have a strong grasp of the fundamental pieces of programming before moving on to complex structures. Many will learn to use moduels - libraries - without understanding the fundamentals of Python. For those like ourselves who use Python for a variety of tasks - especially agent-based modeling and data processing and visualization - it is useful to incur the upfront cost of learning the prgoramming fundamentals. Not long after Jim first began learning to program in Python, he was benefited by Cameron who was already familiar with programming syntax and who also wanted to learn the language. We explored Python with small projects, both of us growing comfortable with the language. The building blocks we learned in the process will be used to help you grow comfortable with Python as well. This book is the fruit of our own development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this book is to quickly provide the skills necessary to use python for the purpose of economic computation. The book is constructed for those who are just learning Python. Each example in the text and each problem at the end of every chapter will help you develop programming fluency. You will learn by doing. Even if you do not feel like you understand the programs that you build, it is important for you to _reconstruct every script_ presented in the book. As you build programs, we encourage you to consider different means by which you could create a similar program and also to consider how you might develop the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to work with objects and functions that are essential to data management and statistical programming. These include working with basic math functions, lists, dictionaries, tuples, if-statements, \"for-loops\", classes, and reading and writing files in Python. As we develop understanding of the core interface, we will also build a statistical packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will learn how to install Python quickly and easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why you should learn Python as compared to R or MATLAB. Although R and MATLAB are both powerful, they are not well-suited for general purpose programming in the way that Java or C++ are. Python does meet this criterion. Python is intuitive, not differing as much as R from the syntax and structure of traditional programming languages. If you learn Python for data analysis, you will also have a head-start on programming for other purposes like web design, natural language processing, graphical user interfaces, and so on. By the time you finish this book, you will be well prepared to develop a practice that includes a broad set of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we will use Python 3. All examples will be generated from Spyder, the Integrated Development Environment provided in Anaconda. Download the Anaconda package at:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the latest installer for Python 3. If you know your system is 64-bit, choose the 64-bit installer. Otherwise, choose the 32-bit installer. **If you have not installed Python on your system before, check the option “Add Anaconda to the system Path environment variable.** This option is “Not recommended” by the installation as it gives Anaconda preference over previously installed software. For our purposes, this should not be a problem. Once you have completed the installation, if you would like to install any package, open the command line (in Windows this is PowerShell) and type conda install package-name where package-name is replaced with the package you wish to install. For example, you can install numpy with conda install numpy. If a package is not available in Anaconda, you can install it using pip install package-name. The latest version of Anaconda will recognize a library installed in this manner. It is sometimes possible to install unofficial releases of packages with Anaconda, but this will not be necessary for the material covered. Unless otherwise specified, the packages we will be using are included in with the Anaconda installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to build your first program, open Spyder. You can find it by using the search function for your operating system. I recommend that you place it somewhere on your desktop or pin it to your taskbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Scripts\n",
    "As you follow along with the book, you may prefer to view the .py scripts in your text editor. All scripts can be found at [the github](https://github.com/jlcatonjr/Learn-Python-for-Stats-and-Econ) for this book."
